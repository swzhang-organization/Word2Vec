# Word2Vec Similarity Web App (Generated by Codex)

This project provides a simple Flask application that computes the
semantic similarity between a target word or phrase and a list of
words/phrases using a preâ€‘trained Word2Vec model.

## Running the app

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Start the web server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
   and enter a target word or phrase along with one word or phrase per
   line to compare.

The first run may download the small `glove-wiki-gigaword-50` model if
not present in the local `gensim` cache.
